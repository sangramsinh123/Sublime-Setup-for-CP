##  C++14.sublime-build (FOR OS X(Mac Users) ) :

Follow the same steps above just copy the sublime build file corresponding to OS X. You need to have gcc and gtimout installed to be able to run above build system.

To install gcc in OS X :
```
brew install gcc
```
To install gtimout in OS X :
```
brew install coreutils
```
Remember you may have to change the version in g++-{version} in sublime build file according to gcc version installed by brew. At the time of writting this post it is 10 hence is written as g++-9
